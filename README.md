# ifundawitch
a CryptoKitties project about past and current witches whom values towards humanity was greatly misunderstood. Ifundawitch is not a project for valuing eccentricity or non-conformism. It's rather a project for understanding society past and present flaws that pushes creativeness into it's bounderies and triggers the necessity of an individual to built autonomous self-sustaining and authenticly natural projects for freedom.
